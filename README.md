# Budget-Scan-iOS
iOS Budget app

First step: Allow users to take pictures, save it

Second step: Upload that picture to Microsoft Project Oxfordâ€™s Computer Vision OCR API (using post request) And Save JSON data

Third Step: Think of ways to interpret data (match item names and price, also receipt date) Hint: perhaps regular expressions in Swift would help

-> No such app exists in App Store
